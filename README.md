# Guess-Game

WELCOME TO GUESS GAME! </br>
I'm thinking of a number between ``1 and 100`` </br>
If your guess is more than 10 away from my nuumber, I'll tell you you're ``COLD``
If your guess is within 10 of my number, I'll tell you you're ``WARM``
If your guess is farther than your most recent guess, I'll say you're getting ``COLDER``
If your guess is closer than your most recent guess, I'll say you're getting ``WARMER``
LET'S PLAY!</br>
